# Portfolio

- My portfolio consists of the projects I worked on during an intensive Data Science Bootcamp **`(November 2021 - June 2022)`**. 
- You can read more about each project by clicking on the folder and checking the **`Read Me`** document. 
- The **`'Sneaker Resell Price Prediction Service (Webpage) Development'`** project was an extension of the **`Sneaker Resell Price Prediction`** project. 
  - I developed a Prediction Service based on the model developed in the **`Sneaker Resell Price Prediction`** project. 
- The projects in the portfolio are my own work on the topics of my choice except for the **`Video game market analysis project`** (mini project topic provided by the data science bootcamp)
